Paperless
=========

Paperless is the fruit of the labor from the [rung team](http://skaffl.com/rung/) of the [Lehigh Valley Startup Weekend Nov 2 - Nov 4](http://lehighvalley.startupweekend.org/). Hackers [Dallas Gutauckis](http://www.github.com/dallasgutauckis) and [Matt Smollinger](http://www.github.com/msmollin) created the core foundation of the rung drawing components with cross-platform communication and capabilities to allow students and teachers to seamlessly manage and collaborate on the workflow for their coursework/homework.
